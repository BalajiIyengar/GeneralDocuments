Git is a content-addressable filesystem. Great. 
What does that mean? It means that at the core of Git is a simple key-value data store.

Every value you store in git returns you a corresponding 40 bit SHA checksum key.
With the key,you could retrieve the contents of the file

For Instance: 
$ git cat-file -p d670460b4b4aece5915caf5c68d12f560a9fe3e4
		returns
test content


where the last part of the git command is the key that was returned by Git 


Git Stores files like a UNIX system.
